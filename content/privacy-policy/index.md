## Privacy Notice

This notice applies across all websites that we own and operate and all services we provide, including our online and mobile accounting and financial services products, and any other apps or services we may offer (our “services”)

When we say “personal data”, we mean information that would identify you, like your name, email, address, telephone number, bank account details, payment information and so on. The same would apply to information that could identify other users in your teams that are shared with TranZact.

If you can't be identified (for example, when personal data has been aggregated and anonymised), the information wouldn't be personal data anymore, and this notice doesn't apply.

We may need to update this notice from time to time. When a significant change is made, we'll make sure we let you know – usually by sending you an email.

# Clause 1: Who are “we”?

When we refer to “we” (or “our” or “us'), that means Megham Garg and all its wholly owned subsidiaries, including the primary operating entity, Megham Garg Our headquarters are in Mumbai but we operate and have offices all over the world. Address details for all TranZact offices are available on our “Contact Us” page.

3. Security: We adopt industry leading approaches to secure the personal data entrusted to us.

# Clause 3: How we collect your data

When you visit our websites or use our services, we collect personal data. The ways we collect it can be broadly categorised into the following:

1. Information you submit in order to use our product: When you use our product, we might ask you to provide personal data to us. For example, we may ask for your information and/or your colleagues' information to create an employee database for various purposes such as accounting and operations. If you don't want to provide us with personal data, you don't have to, but it might mean you can't use some parts of our product.

2. Information you provide to us directly: When you visit or use some parts of our websites and/or services, we might ask you to provide personal data to us. For example, we ask for your contact information when you sign up for a free trial, join us on social media, take part in training and events, contact us with questions or request support. If you don't want to provide us with personal data, you don't have to, but it might mean you can't use some parts of our websites or services.

3. Information we collect automatically: We collect some information about you automatically when you visit our websites or use our product/services, like your IP address and device type.

4. Information we get from third parties: The majority of information we collect, we collect directly from you. Sometimes we might collect personal data about you from other sources, such as publicly available materials or trusted third parties like our marketing and research partners.

- in accordance with a legal obligation; or

- where we have your consent.

# Clause 6: International Data Transfers

1. When we share data, it may be transferred to, and processed in, countries other than the country you live in. These countries may have laws which are different from what you're used to. Rest assured, where we disclose personal data to a third party in another country, we put safeguards in place to ensure your personal data remains protected.

2. For individuals in the European Economic Area (EEA), this means that your data may be transferred outside of the EEA. Where your personal data is transferred outside the EEA, it will only be transferred to countries that have been identified as providing adequate protection for EEA data (like New Zealand), or to a third party where we have approved transfer mechanisms in place to protect your personal data – i.e., by entering into the European Commission's Standard Contractual # Clauses, or by ensuring the entity is Privacy Shield certified (for transfers to US-based third parties).

2. We'll retain your personal data for as long as we have a relationship with you and for a period of time afterwards where we have an ongoing business need to retain it, in accordance with our data retention policies and practices.
